      <p class="description">
        I'm a Software Engineer. I initially chose to learn coding because I was
        inspired by my sibling, who motivated me. About two years ago, I started
        learning from scratch at school, covering topics like HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and Bootstrap in the first year. I also learned design using
        Photoshop and some basic database concepts. In the second year, 2023, I
        began exploring new things at school, like PHP and Laravel. Midway
        through the year, there was an opportunity for a three-month internship,
        and I interned at PT. LSKK in Bandung. There, I learned more about the
        React.js framework and Tailwind CSS. As I entered the third year, I
        became more serious about coding. Although coding can be exhausting at
        times, finding solutions to bugs can be incredibly satisfying. During
        this third year, I delved deeper into Laravel and also explored the
        SvelteKit framework. In the second year, I had already learned about
        MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Node.js, but those were not part of the
        school's curriculum, which focused more on Laravel. Despite the
        challenges, I've completed quite a few projects and found the experience
        rewarding. My strong motivation serves as a foundation to keep pushing
        forward because learning has no limits.
